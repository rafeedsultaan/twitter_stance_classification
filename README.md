# stance-classification-deeplearning


Please perform the following steps to run the project code: 

1.	Clone the notebook and other data files from the provided GitHub Repository (https://github.com/vishalbeniwal/stance-classification-deeplearning)

2.	From the cloned repository, please upload the “FINAL-CODE.ipynb” file to Google colab environment. 

3.	Upload all the data files provided (train.csv, test.csv, independent_dataset.csv) onto your google drive with same names and mount the drive using the code available at the top of notebook. Also, please download the file "glove.twitter.27B.100d.txt" from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ as I have used this pre-trained weight vector. This files also needs to be uploaded on google drive.

4.	Copy the absolute path of files uploaded on the drive. Replace and paste the path in the notebook to the code blocks where the data is being loaded into the notebook. 

5.	Connect the Google Colab with GPU runtime. Go to Runtime and click “Run All”
